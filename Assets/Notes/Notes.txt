- Isometric
- Low-poly style with flat shading.
- Biomes with nice transitions
- Don't need marching cubes, b/c not doing to do destructables for everything, just certain things will be destructable
- I want decent physics for stuff (gravity, water, etc)

Goals:
[x] Basic flat-shaded plane with alternating diagonals
[x] Add height map with random noise
[x] Basic Perlin Noise for better looking terrain

[] Basic chunking
[] Basic chunk loading and saving
[] Multi-threading for chunk stuff
[] Infinite terrain
[] Figure out how to do biomes
	[] Each biome has different noise stuff
	[] biomes need to cross chunks agnostically
	[] biomes need to blend organically where they meet
[] Simple character just for reference (no real physics)
[] Simple destructable trees
[] Physics
[] Water
[] Fun shit
